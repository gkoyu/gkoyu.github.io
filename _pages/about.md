<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am an MPhil candidate in Computer Science and Technology at [Beijing Normal-Hong Kong Baptist University](https://www.uic.edu.cn/en/), advised by [Dr. Bingqing Qu](https://staff.uic.edu.cn/bingqingqu/en).
Previously, I obtained my B.E. in Robotics Engineering from [Guangzhou University](https://www.gzhu.edu.cn/)., where I worked with [Prof. Wenkai Huang](https://jd.gzhu.edu.cn/info/1150/3954.htm) in the AI Lab. During my undergraduate studies, I began exploring the intersection of machine learning and real-world applications in healthcare and multimedia understanding.
 My research interest includes：
- **Video Understanding**
- **Computer Vision**
- **Multimodal Learning**
- **Music Generation**
-  **Medical Image Processing**
  
You can find my CV here:[ Yujia Yu’s Curriculum Vitae](../files/CV.pdf).

- Hyperbolic Music Transformer for Structured Music Generation<br/>
Wenkai Huang,**Yujia Yu**, Haizhou Xu, **IEEE Access**    |   [Link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10070602?denied=)  |  [paper](../images/Hyperbolic Music Transformer for Structured Music.pdf)<br/>

- This paper proposes a Hyperbolic Music Transformer model, which considers the hierarchy in music and models the structured components of music in hyperbolic space. Meanwhile, in order for the network to have sufficient capacity to learn music data with hierarchical and power regular structure, a hyperbolic attention mechanism is proposed, which is an extension of the attention mechanism in hyperbolic space based on the definition of hyperboloid and Klein model.
